**The codebase is horrible**

I apologize for the bad codebase and the bad performance. Opening a chat loads all messages before displaying them. Therefore it's pretty slow when opening chats with a lot of messages and is heavy on the memory.

_[How to request personal data on Instagram](https://help.instagram.com/181231772500920)_

This is a simple tool to view your personal data that you can request on Instagram. I have created this tool because I thought it's pretty unhandy of Instagram to just give the user multiple zip archives containing plain json.
This tool may not be pretty pretty, but it's at least a little easier to read your personal data.

Unfortunately a lot of data e.g. the actual posts that you've commented on, saved etc. are not given in these files by Instagram.

The most important feature for me is having a readable chat where you can actually search for specific messages. I haven't created the chat view yet, but it's the next thing I'll be working on! :)
